# Acadgild-Java-Assignments
My Acadgild.com Java assignments

The author of these Java programs is me, Nivedita Ramakrishnan, @theGazettEINDIA on Twitter.
These programs are all my asisgnments for the Java course I'm now doing at AcadGild.
I have named the programs in this way-->
Program1 or such a "Programn" naming is the nth piece of assignment according to AcadGild's lesson plan.
Part1 or such a "Partn" that immediately follows it is the nth Java session/lesson whose assignment the file is for.
Please reach out to me at the above mentioned Twitter handle for any queries.
