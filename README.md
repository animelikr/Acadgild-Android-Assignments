# Acadgild-Android-Assignments
My Acadgild.com Android assignments

The author of these Android projects is me, Nivedita Ramakrishnan, @theGazettEINDIA on Twitter.
These programs are all my asisgnments for the Android course I'm now doing at AcadGild.
I have named the programs in this way-->
"One...Two...N" naming is the nth piece of assignment according to AcadGild's lesson plan.
Session1 or such a "Session-n" that immediately follows it is the nth Android session/lesson whose assignment the file is for.
Please reach out to me at the above mentioned Twitter handle for any queries.
